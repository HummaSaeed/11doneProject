# Booking Modal Fixes - Complete Summary

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ PayPal Integration Fixed
**Problem**: PayPal payment wasn't working - form was waiting for card details instead of redirecting

**Solution**:
- Updated form submission logic in `public/assets/frontend/js/appointment.js`
- Added gateway type detection (card-based vs redirect-based)
- For PayPal and other redirect gateways, form submits directly without requiring card details
- For Stripe/Authorize.net, card details are collected first
- Added console logging for debugging

**Result**: PayPal now redirects immediately without asking for card information

### 2. ‚úÖ Review Booking Button Now Works
**Problem**: "Review Booking" button wasn't moving to summary step

**Solution**:
- Moved click event binding to modal initialization
- Made `proceedToSummary()` a window-level function
- Added proper event handler with `.off().on()` pattern
- Added error handling and console logging
- Fixed button reference in HTML (removed inline onclick)

**Result**: Button now properly navigates to Step 04 (Summary)
